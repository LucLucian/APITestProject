# APITestProject

### Overview

 Maven API framework using Rest Assured with Java
 
### Motivation

* I choose to create as Maven project because is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation, no need to install any other dependencies.
* REST Assured for automating api tests because it integrates seamlessly with TestNG, JSON Path and XML Path allows us to easily parse the response data and test specific elements and it supports a Given/When/Then test notation, which instantly makes your tests human readable
* IntelliJ because is a programming environment largely meant for Java and integrates great with Maven, Selenium and TestNG.
* For running tests and performing assertions, I decided to go with TestNG and it integrates very nicely with IntelliJ and is an automation testing framework in which NG stands for "Next Generation". TestNG is inspired from JUnit which uses the annotations (@).
